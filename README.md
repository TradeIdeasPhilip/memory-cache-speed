I know how to make memory fast in C++.
Iâ€™m wondering if some of the same tricks apply in JavaScript.

I just finished creating this web page so I could run some tests.
I will have some results to share soon.

If I access memory sequentially rather than randomly, will it make a measurable difference?

My laptop has 3 levels of RAM cache.
I wonder if I can find all 3 of them with my program.
